## Quick start

> If you're on Laravel `4.2` or on `5.0` with PHP `5.4` & above, Please use `0.5` branch.

### Installation

#### Step 1: Install Through Composer

You can either add the package directly by firing this command

```cli
$ composer require irazasyed/laravel-gamp
```

Or add in the `require` key of `composer.json` file manually

```json
"irazasyed/laravel-gamp": "^1.0"
```

And Run the Composer update command

```cli
$ composer update
```

#### Step 2: Add the Service Provider

Open `config/app.php` and, to your "providers" array at the bottom, add:

```php
Irazasyed\LaravelGAMP\LaravelGAMPServiceProvider::class
```

#### Step 3: Add Facade (Optional)

Optionally add an alias to make it easier to use the library. Open `config/app.php` and, to your "aliases" array at the bottom, add:

```php
'GAMP'  => Irazasyed\LaravelGAMP\Facades\GAMP::class
```

#### Step 4: Publish Config

Open your terminal window and fire the following command to publish config file to your config directory:

```cli
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Irazasyed\LaravelGAMP\LaravelGAMPServiceProvider"
```

OR

```cli
$ php artisan vendor:publish
```

The former command publishes config file for just this package and the latter publishes vendor files for other packages too. Depending on what you want to do, you can use any (Doesn't really matter).


## Usage

Open config file `config/gamp.php` and set the `tracking_id` with your Google Analytics tracking / web property ID.
Refer the config file for other default configuration settings.

This Package adds Laravel Support to [GA Measurement Protocol][1] PHP Library by [THE ICONIC](https://github.com/theiconic).
It's simply a wrapper around the library with default config for easier usage with Laravel.
So all the methods listed [here][2] are available and will work seamlessly.

### Example Usage

Send a Page view hit:

```php
$gamp = GAMP::setClientId( '123456' );
$gamp->setDocumentPath( '/page' );
$gamp->sendPageview();
```

Send an Event:

```php
$gamp = GAMP::setClientId( '123456' );
$gamp->setEventCategory('Blog Post')
->setEventAction('Create')
->setEventLabel('Using GAMP In Laravel')
->sendEvent();
```

### Config Overview

Open the config file for detailed comments for each option.

Set your Google Analytics Tracking / Web Property ID in `tracking_id` key **[REQUIRED]**

```php
'tracking_id' => 'UA-XXXX-Y',
```

All other configuration options are optional, use as per your requirements.

To send data over SSL, set `is_ssl` to true.

```php
'is_ssl' => true,
```

To Anonymize IP, set `anonymize_ip` to true.

```php
'anonymize_ip' => true,
```

To Make Async Requests, set `async_requests` to true.

```php
'async_requests'  => true,
```

...

Refer the library's [documentation][2] for other remaining methods and examples, they all work.

> **Note:** You don't have to use the protocol version, tracking id, anonymize ip and async request (non-blocking) methods from the original library as they're automatically set in Service Provider when the package is initialized based on the config file. As long as you update the config file with correct settings, it should work just fine.
